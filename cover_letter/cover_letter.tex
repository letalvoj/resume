To whom it may concern,

I am a recent computer science graduate from Czechia (formerly known as the Czech Republic) and yet I have several years of experience in the field. I started working in Cisco systems as an R\&D engineer when I was in my final year of MSc major in Artificial Intelligence. There I had the opportunity to conduct applied research in the field of network security and learn how to write production-quality code. At the time, I could not see myself as a pure researcher and therefore I took a job at a small startup in Prague where I felt that my contributions could have larger impact.

In the summer of 2016 I was one of the few residents selected to attend an elite summer bootcamp at DataScience Inc. in California, USA, where I fell in love with functional programming. By the end of the program I had solidified my passion for working with abstract concepts and mathematical models. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m also dedicated to producing high quality code which is clear and consistent. I feel that those qualities undoubtedly make me a good fit for a data scientist and I appreciate the opportunity to apply for such a role at your company.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Vojtech Letal
