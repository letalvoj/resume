\section*{About me}
I am a machine learning engineer with rich experience including software engineering and applied research.
During my career, I worked on several ML projects which taught me how to build a data processing pipelines and push models into production.
I am writing production code mainly in Scala, Java, and most recently Python which allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of programming paradigms, data structures, and coding styles and find a passion for functional programming.
Currently, I’d like to either contribute to a product where I’d be able to see the direct impact of my work or to immerse myself into development of a library where the main focus would be performance and code clarity.

\section*{Professional Experience}
\subsubsection*{\bf Senior Machine Learning Engineer \& Tech Lead - Blindspot.ai (Prague, Czechia) \hfill 09/2015--present}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item Leading a team of developers working on several analytical tasks for a US-based cybersec startup
		\item Responsible for developing a real-time event-based anomaly detection platform using Apache Flink and Apache Spark
		\item Prototyped regression model for the Czech presidential election which confidently predicted the outcome from less than 5\% of early results
		\item Contributed to visualization and optimization toolbox which allowed a European fast-food company to optimize its supply chain by 80~km (50\%) or 1~hour (17\%) per delivery route
		\item Worked on toolbox designed to analyze correlations between crimes and external conditions like weather using data from a local police department
		\item Developed custom-tailored software solutions for a variety of problems including data analysis and optimization
	 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\bf DS12 Resident - DataScience Inc. (Culver City, CA, USA)\hfill summer 2016}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item 1 of 9 residents selected to participate in a 12-week elite, intensive residency program
		\item Passed through rigorous admissions process with 2.5\% acceptance rate
		\item Implemented recommendation system with real client data using ALS and pattern mining in Spark
		\item Trained churn prediction model on real client data and identified several likely causes of churn
		\item Designed scalable production ETL pipeline which outperformed legacy SQL-based solution 6x (20 min) and was 36x ($< 1\$$) cheaper to execute
	 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{R\&D - Cisco Systems (Prague, Czechia)\hfill 06/2014--08/2015}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item Worked in a team which developed state-of-the-art anomaly detection system on network traffic data
		\item Implemented novel Bayesian inference algorithm to estimate probability of maliciousness of domains
		\item Extensively used big data technologies such as Twitter Scalding and Apache Spark
	 \end{itemize}
