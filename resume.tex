\section*{About me}
I am a machine learning engineer with rich experience including software engineering and applied research.
During my career, I worked on several ML projects which taught me how to build a data processing pipelines and push models into production.
I am writing production code mainly in Scala and most recently Python which allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of programming paradigms, data structures, and coding styles and find a passion for functional programming.

\section*{Professional Experience}
\subsubsection*{\bf Staff Scientist, AI - Avast s.r.o. (Prague, Czechia) \hfill 04/2021--present}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item Responsible for internal productization of a deep learning platform based on Mill.jl co-developed by Avast and CTU
	 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\bf Senior ML Engineer \& Tech Lead - Blindspot.ai (Prague, Czechia) \hfill 09/2015--04/2021}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item Leading a team of developers working on several analytical and ML tasks for a US-based cybersec startup
		\item Responsible for developing a real-time event-based anomaly detection platform
		\item Prototyped a regression model for the Czech presidential election which confidently predicted the outcome from less than 5\% of early results
		\item Worked on toolbox designed to analyze correlations between crimes and external conditions like weather using data from a local police department
	 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\bf DS12 Resident - DataScience Inc. (Culver City, CA, USA)\hfill summer 2016}
	 \begin{itemize}
