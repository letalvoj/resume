%\section*{Objective}
%My objective is to be satisfied with my everyday job mainly by feeling productive and seeing results of my work.
%I like playing with technologies, exploring data and getting deeper understanding of programming languages.
%I love designing and producing high quality maintainable code.

\section*{Professional Experience}
\subsubsection*{\bf DS12 Resident at DataScience Inc. (Culver City, CA, USA)\hfill summer 2016}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item 1 of 9 residents selected to participate in a 12-week elite, intensive residency program
		\item Passed through rigorous admissions process with 2.5\% acceptance rate
		\item Implemented recommendation system with real client data using ALS and pattern mining in Spark
		\item Trained churn prediction model on real client data and identified several likely causes of churn
		\item Designed scalable production ETL pipeline which outperformed legacy SQL-based solution 6x (20 min) and was 36x ($< 1\$$) cheaper to execute
	 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\bf Software engineer at Blindspot-Solutions (Prague, Czech Republic) \hfill 09/2015--present}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item Developed custom tailored software solutions for a variety of problems including data analysis and optimization
		\item Contributed to visualization and optimization toolbox which allowed a European fast food company to optimize its supply chain by 80~km (50\%) or 1~hour (17\%) per delivery route
		\item Worked on toolbox designed to analyze correlations between crimes and external conditions like weather using data from LAPD
	 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{R\&D in Cisco Systems (Prague, Czech Republic)\hfill 06/2014--08/2015}
	 \begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{-0.25em}
		\item Collaborated with a team which developed state-of-the-art anomaly detection system on network traffic data
		\item Implemented novel Bayesian inference algorithm to estimate probability of maliciousness of domains
		\item Worked extensively with big data technologies such as Twitter Scalding and Apache Spark
	 \end{itemize}
